This GitHub repo, as the name suggests, is purely focused on WebRTC or peer-to-peer real-time communication. This repo consists of two projects named:
  - talkIN - focuses on peer-to-peer(101) real-time video calling whereas
  - weTALK - focuses on peer-to-peer(101) real-time video calling and full-fledged group video conferencing.
